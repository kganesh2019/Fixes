Hello Russell,

I wanted to let you know that I have finished and submitted the PEC.

I have a couple of updates to share with you:

Bloomberg Engineers will be performing the patches remotely.
We have the Zero-Footprint Model (Cloud Model) available for all our customers. However, at present, the servers that stream the data are only situated in the US. As we are concerned about latency issues, we have decided to use the deployed model, where Bloomberg servers are located physically in CT.
Please let me know if you have any feedback or questions regarding this update.

Thank you.
