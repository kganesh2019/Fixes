Hi Russell,

I have completed and submitted the PEC.

#1 -> Patches will be carried out remotely by Bloomberg Engineers.
#2 -> Zero-Footprint Model (Cloud Model) ->  This is available for all the customers. Currently, the servers streaming the data are only located in the US. Hence due to latency concerns we opted for the deployed model (with the Bloomberg Servers physically located in CT)
